## Research

### S-Search (Small Simple Search Engine for Article / Paper Abstracts)
An attempt to develop a similarity search model capable of generating optimal numeric text representations for more than one language. The final intended use would be to build some search engine. Still doing reviews of related material to establish what is feasible. Feel free to reach out and help. A demo of how semantic search can be used can be seen [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/eolang/Search); although in English, this tool tries to return similar research papers/works based on the user queries.

### [Swahili transformer language models (Experiments & Finanlizing Phase)](https://huggingface.co/TUS)
A research paper comparing existing languages models both for multilingual and unilingual cases then propose a new fill-mask model and accompanying tokenizer to aid in filling the gap for low-resource NLP


## Projects
### [Youtube video transcription using Openai Whisper](https://github.com/e-olang/NLP/tree/main/Whipser%20ASR)
Using Open AI's Whipser to transcribe audio to text. Audio files extracted from Youtube video URLs. Models used: Tiny, Base & Small.
Try out the live App [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/eolang/Whisper-Transcriber).

### [Animating Covid-19 Vacination Progress](https://github.com/e-olang/Drafts/tree/master/Visualizations/Covid19%20Vaccination%20Time%20Series)
Visualizing progress of admistering Covid-19 vaccines globaly based on time series data from [The Humanitarian Data Exchange](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/covid-19-vaccinations). 

### [Text Summarization Demo](https://github.com/e-olang/NLP/blob/main/Text%20Summarization/v1.ipynb)
Simple demostration on impleneting text summarization using Spacy NLP library. This could however be improved using a better tokenizer e.g. a custom higging face tokeizer built on the data from a specifc field as opposed to using general white space tokenizers.

### [Exploraotry Analysis & Topic Modelling](https://github.com/e-olang/NLP/blob/main/Topic%20Modelling/topic_modelling_v2.ipynb)
Text Exploartory analysis and topic modeling in the ['How ISIS Uses Twitter'](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fifthtribe/how-isis-uses-twitter) dataset from Kaggle. This was done using Latent Dirichlet Allocation Algorithm.


### [Swahili Word Embeddings Using Word2Vec](https://github.com/e-olang/NLP/tree/main/Swahili/Word2Vec%20-%20Model)
A demo on traning word embedings which can be used as features in place of Tf-Idf &/ Count Vectorizer features.
